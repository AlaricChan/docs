Contributing to RackHD
======================

Our project is relatively new, so we don't yet have many hard and fast rules.

As the project grows and more people get involved, we may find the need to 
solidify our contributing guides.

e certainly welcome and encourage contributions in the form of issues and pull requests are welcomed and encouraged.



Understand the Repositories
-------------------------------------------------

The https://github.com/emccode/RackHD repository acts as a single source location to help you get or build all the pieces to learn about, take advantage of, and contribute to RackHD.
A thorough understanding of the repositories is essential for contributing to the project.

The repositories are described in our documentation at
http://rackhd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/repositories.html.





Submitting Contributions
----------------------------------------


To submit coding additions or changes for a repository, fork the repository and clone it locally. Then use a unique branch to make commits and send pull requests.

Keep your Pull requests limited to a single issue. Make sure that the description of the pull requests is clear and complete.

Run your changes against any existing tests or create new ones if needed. Keep tests as simple as possible.  Make sure your changes donâ€™t break the existing project.

After receiving the pull request, wWe will give you feedback on your work and may request that you make further changes and resubmit the request. We will handle all merges.


Issues and Bugs
-----------------------------------

Use the Issues section of each repository to raise issues, ask questions, and report bugs.
