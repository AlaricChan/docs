Welcome to RackHD Documentation
==================================
About RackHD
==================================
Hardware M&O software solution that interfaces with the managed hardware and provides an abstracted view to north bound applications.


RackHD Key Benefits
==================================
Add intro statement...high level sections:
Manage - discovery, genealogy, power
Monitor - telemetry, health, performance
Maintain - firmware updates

Getting Started
==================================
(TEST) In a Converged Infrastructure Platform (CIP) architecture, RackHD software provides hardware management and orchestration (M&O). It serves as an abstraction layer between other M&O layers and the underlying physical hardware. Developers can use the RackHD API to create a user interface that serves as single point of access for managing hardware services regardless of the specific hardware in place.

Using the API
==================================
